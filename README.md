It's an apocalypse for the whole family!

Made with my two great little brothers, Philippe and Nicolas Ollivier, over my holiday break. 

Zombies have invaded the city! 

Search for food as they chase you, and capture it with your trusty NET-3000!

Use your childhood baseball bat to send them swinging! 

Live as long as possible, and comment your longest time alive!



Controls:

WASD to move character

Left Mouse Click to swing bat
